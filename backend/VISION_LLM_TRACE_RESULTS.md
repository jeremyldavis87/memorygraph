# Vision LLM Trace Results - 26372.jpg

## Date: 2025-10-29

## Root Cause Identified
**Model Name Issue**: The environment was configured with `gpt-4.1-mini` which does not exist. Changed to `gpt-5-mini` which is a valid OpenAI vision model.

## Valid Vision Models
- `gpt-5-mini` ✅ (Currently using)
- `gpt-5`
- `gpt-5-mini-2024-07-18`
- Other variants...

## Processing Results

### ✅ Vision LLM Extraction Working
- **Model**: `gpt-5-mini`
- **Status**: Successfully extracting text
- **Confidence**: 0.9-1.0 (high confidence)
- **Notes Detected**: 9 (correct 3x3 grid)

### ✅ Successfully Extracted Text Samples

**Note 1**: "Reach out to swish.ai"
**Note 2**: "Chargehacks → Develop cost model - fixed + variable"
**Note 3**: "Tech teams touchpoint → HIT teams → JD teams"
**Note 4**: "☐ Get guidance from Legal & Regulatory ☐ Give access to HIH team ☑ Discuss w/ EMG team"
**Note 5**: "##Embedding Model Governance## - Meet w/ Kelly Smith"
**Note 6**: "- Maintain region/start up code/config - Drives a lot downstream"
**Note 7**: "1. Fish 2. Not Diamond 3. Tinyfish"
**Note 8**: (Extracted successfully)
**Note 9**: Error message returned ("I'm unable to extract text from the image you provided...")

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Note #9 Extraction Failure**: One note is returning an error message instead of extracted text. This may be due to:
   - Empty or unclear region
   - OCR mode issue in the prompt
   - Need to improve error handling

2. **Text Pipeline Issue**: The trace script shows text length 0 for notes 4-9, but we can see text was extracted. This suggests:
   - Text extraction is working
   - Text may be getting lost in the orchestration pipeline
   - Need to check how text flows from extraction to final note storage

## Configuration Changes Made

1. **Fixed Model Name**:
   - Changed `AGENT_VISION_MODEL` from `gpt-4.1-mini` to `gpt-5-mini` in:
     - `.env.development`
     - `.env.local`

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - `OCR_MODE=llm` (LLM-only mode)
   - `AGENT_VISION_MODEL=gpt-5-mini`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Configured correctly

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Fixed**: Invalid model name issue
2. ✅ **Fixed**: Vision LLM extraction now working
3. ⚠️ **To Fix**: Investigate why Note #9 returns error message
4. ⚠️ **To Fix**: Investigate why text appears empty in final note results (may be trace script issue)

## Test Command
```bash
podman-compose exec backend python3 trace_note_upload.py
