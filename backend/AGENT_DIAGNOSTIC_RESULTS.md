# Agent Processing Diagnostic Results

## Issues Identified

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Environment Variables Not Loading
**Problem:** `.env.development` was not being loaded properly, causing OpenAI API key to be `None`.

**Root Cause:** 
- `pydantic-settings` `BaseSettings` needs the env file specified in `model_config`
- The old approach tried to load in `__init__` but it was too late

**Fix:** 
- Added explicit `load_dotenv()` call at module level before Settings initialization
- Updated to use Pydantic v2's `SettingsConfigDict` 
- Specified `env_file=".env.development"` in config

```python
# Load .env.development first, before Settings is initialized
env_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / ".env.development"
if env_path.exists():
    load_dotenv(env_path)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_file=".env.development",
        env_file_encoding="utf-8",
        case_sensitive=True,
        extra="ignore"
    )
```

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Braintrust Logging API Errors
**Problem:** Using `span.log()` with keys like `stage`, `status`, `quality` caused errors with new Braintrust API.

**Error:** 
```
ValueError: The following keys are not permitted: {'quality', 'stage', 'status'}
```

**Fix:** Commented out problematic Braintrust logging calls

### 3. ✅ FIXED: OCR Mode Not Respected
**Problem:** The UI had OCR mode options (traditional/llm/auto) but they weren't being passed to the agent processing pipeline.

**Fix:**
- Updated upload endpoint to pass `ocr_mode` in config
- Modified `ExtractionAgent` to respect the mode:
  - `traditional`: OCR only
  - `llm`: Vision LLM only  
  - `auto`: Both OCR + Vision LLM in parallel (hybrid)

### 4. ⚠️ CURRENT: OpenAI Quota Exceeded
**Status:** The OpenAI API key has exceeded its quota, causing 429 errors.

**Error:**
```
Client error '429 Too Many Requests' 
'insufficient_quota'
```

**Impact:** Vision LLM extraction is failing, falling back to OCR-only mode which gives poor results.

**Solution:** Need to check OpenAI account billing/quota or use a different API key.

## What's Actually Happening

### Image Processing Flow (when working correctly):

1. **Image Upload** → Frontend sends file to `/api/v1/notes/upload`
2. **File Saved** → UUID filename in `uploads/` directory
3. **Routing Decision**:
   - If `current_user.multi_note_detection_enabled` → Agent processing
   - Otherwise → Traditional OCR fallback

4. **Agent Processing** (when enabled):
   - **ImageProcessingAgent**: Preprocesses image, detects pen colors
   - **SeparationAgent**: Detects individual note regions (QR codes, contours, or Vision LLM)
   - For each region:
     - **ExtractionAgent**: Extracts text using OCR, Vision LLM, or both based on `ocr_mode`
     - **StructureRecognitionAgent**: Identifies titles, sections, lists, tags
     - **PostProcessAgent**: Corrects OCR errors
     - **MetadataAgent**: Extracts QR codes, EXIF data
   - Returns comprehensive `ProcessingOutput` with all notes

### Current State

From the test run on `tests/test-files/26372.jpg`:
- ✅ Agent architecture is working
- ✅ Successfully detects 4 note regions
- ✅ OCR extraction working (confidence: 40-57%)
- ❌ Vision LLM failing due to quota issues
- ❌ Falls back to OCR-only, resulting in poor quality text

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Update OpenAI API key in `.env.development` with a valid key that has quota
2. **Short-term:** Add better error handling for API quota issues with graceful degradation
3. **Medium-term:** Implement caching layer for Vision LLM results to reduce API calls
4. **Long-term:** Consider adding support for other vision models (Claude, Gemini) as fallbacks
